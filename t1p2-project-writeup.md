### Project Overview

#### Section 1: Running Speeds
**How often are athletes reaching â‰¥ 90% maximum velocity throughout a training season?**



**Should we consider the number of sprinting efforts that athletes are completing?**



**Are relative efforts and bands more advantageous than the absolute bands provided?**



**How does sprinting exposure (# of efforts, % max reached) relate to incidence of hamstring injuries?**




#### Section 2: Running Imbalance
**What is the variation at the team level and at each individual athlete level?**

  To understand the relationship that running imbalance has with time for the team as a whole, the average of the team's absolute value running imbalance were looked at over time. Since January 1, 2024, in general there were no large spikes in average absolute running imbalance for the team. Dates in which there is a noticeable spike are dates in which only 1 player recorded a running imbalance measurement and was therefore not indicative of the team as a whole. With this, all players in this analysis will be treated independently from one another.

  Looking ahead to see the relationship between running imbalance and HSI risk, the Running Imbalance data set was broken up into players who did and did not sustain a hamstring injury since January 1, 2024. From there, three different bootstraps were performed to understand the differences in running imbalance between the two groups.
  
  The first bootstrap was used to compare the the variance in running imbalance between the two groups, assuming that players are independent of one another. This bootstrap revealed that the group of players who sustained a hamstring injury have a greater variance in running imbalance than the group that did not sustain an injury with 90% confidence by 0.2310 to 3.4866. 
  
  Along this same thread, another bootstrap was constructed which calculated each player's variance from January 1, 2024 to the present. This means that each player had their own variance measurement and the variance wasn't calculated from the pooled bootstrap resampling algorithm. This bootstrap revealed that with 90% confidence, players who had a hamstring injury had a greater average variance than their uninjured counterparts between 0.7859 and 1.3262. This, like the last bootstrap supports the idea that players who sustained a hamstring injury have on average higher variance in their running imbalance. 
  
  To understand whether or not preference for one side has a relationship with HSI risk, the third bootstrap looked at the average absolute value for each group. This bootstrap revealed that with 90% confidence the true difference in average absolute value between the groups is between 0.0535% and 0.3255%. While the difference between the two groups is statistically significant at the $\alpha=0.1$ significance level, the values are so small that in practice, using these values to try and differentiate the groups would be difficult considering that running imbalance ranges from 0% to 100%.
  
  
  
**What is a meaningful change? What red flags should go off when we see a week-to-week change in running imbalance?**



**Is running imbalance sensitive enough of a metric to use as a prognosis tool versus a rehab tool?**




### Code Implementation
  The code for this project was designed to run sequentially. There are chunks throughout the analysis, usually at the end of each question, that remove objects from your environment that were created in the preceding analysis that are no longer needed. These were put in to increase efficiency and make it clear which objects were used for which analysis. This analysis also includes tools from the *gt*, *aod*, *lme4*, *boot*, *mgcv*, and *leaps* libraries and for someone cloning this repository, may require them to install the appropriate packages to access these libraries. 
  
  The first section is made up of the code that reads in and cleans the three data sets that will be used for the analysis. The Catapult data set will be used to look at running speeds, the Historical Running data set will be used for running imbalance and the Incident Report data will be used to look at injuries.
  
  The Catapult data set was filtered down to only include columns that had relevant statistics for the player such as their anonymous identifier and position and information about their velocities categorized through bands. The Historical Running data set only contained the anonymous ID, Date, and Running Imbalance value. So the only cleaning on this data set was to filter out rows with missing data. The Incident Report data set was filtered down to only look at Hamstring injuries(rows where column "OSICS14.Code" = "TM1"). All of the data sets were also filtered down to only include data from January 1, 2024 and on.
